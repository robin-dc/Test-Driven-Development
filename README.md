## 📍 Why Learn TDD?
Learning Test-Driven Development (TDD) in JavaScript is essential for several reasons. Firstly, TDD promotes a more structured and disciplined approach to software development. By writing tests before implementing the functionality, developers gain a clear understanding of the desired behavior and can focus on writing code that fulfills those requirements. This helps in producing more reliable and maintainable code, as tests act as a safety net against regressions when making changes or adding new features. Secondly, TDD encourages modular and loosely coupled code through its emphasis on writing small, focused tests. This leads to better code organization, improved code reusability, and easier refactoring. Lastly, TDD facilitates collaboration and communication among team members. Tests serve as executable documentation, providing a shared understanding of the code's functionality and aiding in effective collaboration.
